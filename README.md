 This is a portfolio website implemented in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which uses Notion as a CMS. This repo is deployed on
 [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Intro
Before this project, I was using [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as a headless CMS for my 
personal website. After bumping into [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x), I decided to use Notion as the 
CMS while I had most my notes and writings there.
